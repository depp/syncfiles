# Character Conversion Data Generator

Used by SyncFiles.

This program generates the tables necessary to convert between UTF-8 and various historical Mac OS character sets. Not all character sets are currently supported.

Right now, the table format is not quite finalized, so the output is not checked in to version control. This means that you have to run this program in order to generate the data and compile SyncFiles. It is planned to check the data files in, making this step unnecessary.
